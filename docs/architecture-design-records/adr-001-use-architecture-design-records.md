# ADR 001: Use Architecture Design Records

## Context

As this repository hosts Dev Container features and environment setups that evolve over time, it is vital to track the design choices, constraints, and trade-offs made during development. Without a record of these decisions, it is difficult for human maintainers and autonomous AI agents to understand the historical context, leading to potential regression, confusion, or duplicate work when refactoring.

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Design Records (ADRs) to document all major repository design and structure decisions. 
* All ADRs will be stored in `docs/architecture-design-records/`.
* ADRs will follow a sequential numbering scheme (`adr-001-name.md`, `adr-002-name.md`, etc.).
* Every record will follow a standard structure detailing Context, Decision, and Consequences.
* Autonomous AI agents are required to consult existing ADRs and write new ADRs when proposing structural changes.

## Consequences

* **Positive**:
  * Historical design context is preserved directly in the codebase.
  * AI agents can query this directory to quickly align with established architectural patterns.
  * Clear accountability and timeline of technical choices.
* **Neutral/Negative**:
  * Slight overhead to draft and review ADRs during pull requests/refactoring.
